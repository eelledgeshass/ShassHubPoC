# ShassHubPoC #

This is a proof-of-concept project to have a Home Controller/Hub to connect to a MQTT service and subscribe to a published topic.

Use the MQTT service of your choice. Edit the "BrokerHostSettings" of the  "appsettings.json" and make sure the MQTT service is up before running the application.
